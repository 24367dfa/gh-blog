Welcome to the GitHub-hosted example blog!

The purpose of this site is to show how to create a semi-dynamic site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) in a repository that can be public without leaking personal or sensitive information.

The content is structured so that its time-line would match creating such blog, i.e. the order of the posts represents the order of steps taken to set everything up. Additional resources will go to distinct pages for easy access.

When reading the content, it is also worth to also check out the [sources on GitHub](https://github.com/penguineer/gh-blog).

Showing off fancy Web Design is not so much on the bucket list. The style is held rather simplistic, as any HTML/CSS/x can be rendered and a production setup would use a more accomplished approach.

If you would like to fix mistakes or add content, please feel free to add a Pull Request or open an  Issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/penguineer/gh-blog)!

Enjoy reading and let us know if these resources were helpful for creating your own site!
